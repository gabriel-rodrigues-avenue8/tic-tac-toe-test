# Getting Started with this test

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). The goal is to be a boilerplate to create
a Tic Tac Toe game.

If you're not familiar with this game, you can take a look of [its rules in
Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) as this is a pretty
familiar game for a lot of people but under very different names.

And if you want to play it to get a feeling of the rules in case you don't
know the game, you can search for `Tic Tac Toe Game` in Google and it will
actually show you a Tic Tac Toe Game to play with.

This is an open-ended challenge, meaning that it is not required that you
actually finish the implementation, we are much more interested in your
methods than your output. Communication is key and asking questions can
save massive amounts of time, so try to create the game, we will help
you as you code it, trying to be helpful and asking for the reasons of
decisions made to make the implementation move forward.

As this is intended to be a live coding challenge, candidates gets anxious
and nervous, that's normal, even expected, don't worry, being anxious
and writing typos will not degrade our evaluation of your work, and you
will not code under pressure or vigilance of any kind in our company.

This challenge is meant to gauge communication and skills of teamwork in
a simulated pair programming experience.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
